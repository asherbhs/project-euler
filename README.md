# Project Euler solutions in multiple languages
This repository contains solutions to Project Euler problems in multiple programming languages.

The solutions are not intended to be perfect, but rather to illustrate the different approaches to solving a problem that each language lends itself to.

The current languages that solutions exist for are (alphabetically):
- C
- Haskell
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python

Languages which I aim to include in the future are:
- C#
- Rust
- JavaScript/TypeScript

~~I simply do not want to learn C++~~
