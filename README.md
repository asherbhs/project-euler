# Project Euler solutions in multiple languages

## Solutions
This repository contains solutions to Project Euler problems in multiple programming languages.

The solutions are not intended to be perfect, but rather to illustrate the different approaches to solving a problem that each language lends itself to.

The current languages that solutions exist for are (alphabetically):
- C
- Haskell
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python

Languages which I aim to include in the future are:
- C#
- Rust
- JavaScript/TypeScript

~~I simply do not want to learn C++~~

## Scripts
The repository also contains scripts that compile and run solution files, cleaning up addition files created in the process. In addition, there is a script which times how long the solution in each language takes to run, which can be used as a benchmark for the speed of each language.
