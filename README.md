# Project Euler solutions in various languages

## Solutions

This repository contains solutions to Project Euler problems in multiple programming languages. For some problems I do solutions in many languages to see their differences, for others I just use the best language for the job.

## Scripts

The repository also contains scripts that compile and run solution files, cleaning up additional files created in the process. In addition, there is a script which times how long the solution in each language takes to run, which can be used as a benchmark for the speed of each language.
